This is a (rather shitty) solution to the 2016 #vhack event by forbes/microsoft in the machine learning nomination by beeline. It's using keras to predict removed edges. In the create_user_profiles.py, averaged profile of each user's input and output is created, and then used in one of the features generated by mlp.py. There the input edges are sliced and fed into the network to train it. It should be run multiple times. result.py generated a .npz archive of 10,000,000 predicted edges which I later clipped to a random batch of 1,000,000 and used in result.py to generate a solution .csv.
